# NotPinterested for Ecosia

## What?

NotPinterested is a Chrome Extension, which removes Pinterest content from Ecosia image search results.

## Why?

Pinterest pollutes image search results by creating a walled garden, which is impossible to access without a Pinterest account. This makes image searches more time-consuming and, ultimately, irritating.
