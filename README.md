# NotPinterested for Ecosia

## What?

NotPinterested is a Chrome Extension, which removes Pinterest content from <a href="https://ecosia.org" target="_blank">Ecosia</a> image search results.

## Why?

Pinterest pollutes image search results by creating a walled garden, which is impossible to access without a Pinterest account. This makes image searches more time-consuming and, ultimately, irritating.

So, this is a project born from rage, because it I wrote it one afternoon when I had been subjected to just one too many inaccessible Pinterest image links. I was also procrastinating over something vastly more important that I had to do, but isn't it always the way?

There's already an excellent extension, called Unpinterested that removes them from Google, but I prefer the Ecosia search engine.

## You could just sign up for Pinterest...

No.

## It's not working!

Oh, ok. I'm sorry about that. Please open an issue here on GitHub, and I'll take a look. The code itself is very straightforward, so if you know what's wrong, feel free fix it and create a Pull Request.

Please note that the extension is provided "as-is". No warranty or guarantee regarding suitability or compatibility is given. Use it at your own risk, and let's hope that when they announce that the world is ending, it's not in the form of a Pinterest image!

## How much data do you collect?

None, zilch, zip, nada. You can check the code for yourself. The extension uses a teeny bit of storage in your browser so it knows whether it's switched on or off, but that's all. There's a <a href="https://mattrudge.net/privacy.html" target="_blank">funky privacy policy</a> too if you're still unconvinced.

## Anything else?

I realise that my audience for this extension is vanishingly small. After all, Ecosia is still quite a niche search engine, although I hope more people start using it.

If you are in the "Uses Ecosia, but doesn't have a Pinterest account" club, and this extension makes your life a little bit easier, then I always accept an oat milk cappuccino.

If you're not yet in this exclusive club, then could I at least encourage you to use Ecosia as your preferred search engine?
